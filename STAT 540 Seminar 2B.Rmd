# Seminar 2b

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```


To practice graphing in ggplot2, the **mpg** data frame was explored.

This data frame was loaded by running the following:

```{r}
mpg
```

Next, a preliminary graph was made from the data:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class))
```

Finally, to complete the deliverable for this seminar, the above graph was modified to add colour, and appear identical to the provided visual that needed to be replicated.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class, colour = drv))
```
